              Why did I leave the job I once loved?

              <br /><br />

              While I loved working for Dutch Bros, It didn't take too much
              investigation for my friends and collegues to see that, my true
              passion was for technological innovation. Over my 5 years working
              for the company I designed the inventory system that is now in use
              by all 24 phoenix locations. I sat down with the franchise owner
              and let him know what he needed to do in order to save hundreds of
              thousands per year and at that point I was asked to design a class
              to help all of the other stores in the company improve their
              payroll and product cost.

              <br /><br />

              Even though I felt I was making an impact, I felt there was more I
              could do. Sadly, I knew I would never be able to gain the
              technical skills I needed in order to pursue my coding passion
              while still working or Dutch Bros. When I started to feel that my
              time with the company was coming to an end, it was difficult to
              say goodbye, but I knew it had potential to be the best decision I
              had ever made.
              <br /><br />

              This is where GCU comes in. Shortly after leaving Dutch, I started
              working for and attending GCU as a computer programming student. I
              owe so much to Grand Canyon for helping grow this late-night,
              untamed, untrained coder into a refined, efficient and
              knowledgeable full-stack developer.

              <br /><br />

              Nearly every day for the past 18 months has ended in the early
              hours of the morning for me as I have been tirelessly working to
              hone my skills as a developer. All of this effort is in
              preparation for my first job in the industry. I feel that day is
              coming soon, and I can't wait!

              I found Dutch Bros Coffee when I was 19 years old, and absolutely
              miserable in my current college major. I was instantly in love. In
              my mind, there was nothing more to be gained from life than
              slamming coffee, listening to high energy music, and serving
              others with the help of my friends.

              <br /><br />

              I quickly climbed the ranks within the company, eventually serving
              as the general manager for the busiest location in phoenix.
              However, while my love for the company and for serving others
              remained, I realized over the years that I did not have a strong
              interest in managing employees. As a manager, my strengths were in
              innovation. In fact, I believe the reason I was able to climb the
              ladder so quickly was in part due to my ability to improve the
              operations of every store I visited through the implementation of
              technology.
