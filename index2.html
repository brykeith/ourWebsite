          Why did I leave the job I once loved? 
          <br><br>

          While I loved working for Dutch Bros, It didn't take too much investigation for my friends and collegues to see that, my true passion was for technological innovation. Over my 5 years working for the company I designed the inventory system that is now in use by all 24 phoenix locations. I sat down with the franchise owner and let him know what he needed to do in order to save hundreds of thousands per year and at that point I was asked to design a class to help all of the other stores in the company improve their payroll and product cost.     
          <br><br>

          Even though I felt I was making an impact, I felt there was more I could do. Sadly, I knew I would never be able to gain the technical skills I needed in order to pursue my coding passion while still working or Dutch Bros. When I started to feel that my time with the company was coming to an end, it was difficult to say goodbye, but I knew it had potential to be the best decision I had ever made.
          <br><br>

          This is where GCU comes in. Shortly after leaving Dutch, I started working for and attending GCU as a computer programming student. I owe so much to Grand Canyon for helping grow this late-night, untamed, untrained coder into a refined, efficient and knowledgeable full-stack developer. 
          <br><br>

          Nearly every day for the past 18 months has ended in the early hours of the morning for me as I have been tirelessly working to hone my skills as a developer. All of this effort is in preparation for my first job in the industry. I feel that day is coming soon, and I can't wait!

          I found Dutch Bros Coffee when I was 19 years old, and absolutely miserable in my current college major. I was instantly in love. In my mind, there was nothing more to be gained from life than slamming coffee, listening to high energy music, and serving others with the help of my friends. 
          <br><br>

          I quickly climbed the ranks within the company, eventually serving as the general manager for the busiest location in phoenix. However, while my love for the company and for serving others remained, I realized over the years that I did not have a strong interest in managing employees. As a manager, my strengths were in innovation. In fact, I believe the reason I was able to climb the ladder so quickly was in part due to my ability to improve the operations of every store I visited through the implementation of technology.
